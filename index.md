B.A. Geography, B.A. Applied Mathematics and Statistics (honors) *cum laude*

## Professional Experience

`May to August 2019`
**Metropolitan Council of the Twin Cities** | Data Science Intern

* Found and implemented an algorithm to aggregate census block groups according to contextual and compositional variables in order to create larger geographies with lower standard errors that are still contextually meaningful to local planners

* Designed Bayesian hierarchical models and ecological inference models to study regional park visitation patterns using location-based services data

* Used Public Use Microdata Survey data to create a series of visualizations about the intersection of race and disability in the Twin Cities for use by the Council for transportation equity planning

`January to May 2019`
**Macalester College Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science Department** | Saint Paul, MN | Teaching Assistant, Machine Learning and Statistical Computing (MATH 253)

* Attended class to assist with activities and lectures

* Held four office hours per week to answer homework and general course questions

* Served as a mentor for students interested in data science and statistics beyond the course

* Graded in-class activities, homework, and quizzes promptly

* Met regularly with the professor to discuss my work and ways to improve

`June to August 2018`
**Voting Rights Data Institute at Tufts University and MIT** | Somerville, MA | Undergraduate Summer Fellow

* Managed a team to build an [open source shapefile](https://github.com/mggg/ohio-precincts) of 2016 voting precincts in
Ohio using digitization of PDF maps and computational methods to approximate
boundaries in counties without maps

* Designed and wrote a [handbook for digitizing precinct maps](https://www.katiejolly.io/pdf/digitizing_guide.pdf) using QGIS aimed at volunteers with limited GIS background

* Wrote a [map design guide](https://www.katiejolly.io/pdf/VRDI%20Map%20Guide.pdf) aimed at mathematicians to explain concepts like projection, classification schemes, and color choices

* Presented updates weekly in an informal session with other fellows and mentors

* Pair-programmed an interactive Shiny app showing the output from the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that creates millions of potential districting plans by mapping district flips of individual precincts for use by other researchers

`August 2017 to December 2018`
**Macalester College Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science Department** | Saint Paul, MN | Teaching Assistant, Introduction to Data Science (COMP 112)

* Attended class to assist with activities and lectures

* Held four office hours per week to answer homework and general course questions

* Served as a mentor for students interested in data science and statistics beyond the course, particularly the first-year students

* Graded in-class activities and homework promptly
